Where grass looks like velvet,---  
the boulders and rocks  
like buttons and brooches   
you are up above the timber line  
where the world   
looks like a model of the world,  
an earth-like imitation,  
the breeze is genuinely brisk –  
it could blow you off   
the earth   
from up here.

*

No looking forward or back  
just look around   
at pillows of low-lying vegetation,  
succulent purple flowers,  
an alpine soapwort  
or the mountain pasque  
in August  
their bloom now faded,  
only a dried spiraled puff  
remains.

Above the timber line 

(where the precious air  
puts you in a frenzy  
producing   
amazingly keen thoughts  
achieved normally  
through vigorous  
spiritual discipline)

you follow the path  
for treacherous trekking   
each step must be secure  
as you cross the terrain  
some two thousand meters  
above sea-level,  
one careful step  
and the weight of your foot  
has set pebbles loose;  
you listen   
to them roll  
(the rolling of pebbles)  
as they slide down the incline.   
Now you’ve sent them  
over bare earth and stones  
(no more grass here)   
but you carry on   
over rocks  
listening to the tap of your stick  
way up above the timber line.

*

Above the timber line  
you come to a brook:   
narrow at first  
then the water widens,  
spreads out over a white plateau  
and tumbles  
down the mountain  
to pastures & cows  
to forests.  
You drink the water   
ferociously  
you wash your face  
and neck  
(you drink and drink)  
until the water revives you

and you can wander off the trail  
to follow the brook upwards  
to find its source  
a blue pond   
shaded by gravelly high slopes   
that lead to jagged formations  
making sharp zigzags  
across the sky.

*

Wind whistles in your ears  
blowing ripples  
over the water  
varying its shades of turquoise  
and when it’s still  
you notice a patch of snow  
melting at the pond’s edge  
by its constant drip into water.

*

There you sit way above the timber line  
on the rock studded with garnets   
little stony knobs hiding their brilliance  
but you scratch at one  
to catch a glimpse of the dark purple gems  
and stare at the water, the smooth pond floor,   
while you eat your sandwich  
and discover tiny flowers  
growing up   
out of patches of moss.

*

Climb off the rock  
to examine the soldanella  
so minuscule next to huge gray boulders   
their blooms   
like fringed purple trumpets  
all above the timber line.

*

Treacherous hiking behind you  
and still more up ahead  
that leads you up there  
in the sunshine  
over the notch   
in the back of the mountain  
by the dagger formations  
and down to a cirque,   
that opens and flattens   
first gray & steep   
before changing over into wide velvety green.

*

The land comes to an abrupt drop  
and you will think you’ve come   
to the end of the world,  
not yet realizing  
there will be another lake   
where you will bathe  
(not like this pond here  
where you can only  
dip your toe  
for a split second),  
your body will ache then tingle    
from the cold;  
it will make you   
screech with pleasure  
close to the timber line.

*

At the pond  
you wonder about what’s ahead  
(though you see that notch  
and know you can make it).

*

A small plane  
flies above  
not far off  
just by the jagged tips  
you can hear its rumbling motor.

Wave to it! wave!<br>  
I’m here, I’m down here!<br>  
Please come rescue me<br>  
from all this inebriating air!
