—a new recipe small pieces  
of asparagus & shrimp lemon juice  
prepared in separate pan & I think  
of G.—when did I last cook risotto when  
did I last eat asparagus in March  
of which year

I am transported to Austrian spring  
crispy temperature a field of brooks  
where we pick birds’ lettuce  
we hike we cook  
there is sex there is spring  
& asparagus some cress &  
birds’ lettuce picked at the brook  
I stir risotto & think how this recipe  
diverges from G.’s—to place inch-sized  
asparagus pieces in bowl of ice water  
I’ll try but remember
