title: Swimming Particles in a field
layout: "poem.njk"

old swivel chair I sit<!-- end -->  
at vintage dining table  
for desk, I swim through   
grainy computer interface   
with 1939 letter;   
handwriting   
enlarged in PDF file   
to better decipher  
lines and curls   
etched with ink  
and nib on paper

crickets buzzing in spine   
flowing to other end   
of faces I’ve never met

staring at white walls;   
on the other side   
a man clears his throat

I read letters   
written by a woman  
named Paula,   
examine curlicue and dots  
—she adds a p.s. to her girlie  
—why no letter from her?  
the safety of her children—  
she is sick with worry;  
a boy named Georg—  
a screen between Paula  
and me 

a wall between me   
and the man,  
a door into yard  
where I have planted  
Moroccan mint;  
I hear swing set song  
from playground  
at the end   
of the West 22nd  
street block 

how Paula dots her i’s    
writes the letter ‘m’   
like an ‘h’   
and remains in Vienna   
while her children have   
arrived elsewhere, 

New York acquaintances  
Paula envies   
for breathing   
the same air as; 

little guppy mouths make an O shape,   
owl faced creatures cooing in my ear,   
whispering 

barking of dog in playground  
merges with man’s barking cough   
and I speak to the paint,   
to the man in pain,   
‘Who devoured   
my Moroccan mint?’

Paula will be cornered in,   
betrayed by a lawyer,   
then scooped up by Nazis, 

moaning man   
studies Arabic   
explains   
the history   
of this building,  
says once a man   
in here had a python  
and chickens out back,  
they made horrible sounds  
heard clear through the building

and Paula scooped up by the Nazis  
after desperate sale of home as I sit  
on train with speckles of Hudson light;

I write Mother, I know this time of year   
so hard for you, my eyes fill with oceans  
of green light and Hudson speckles  
laying hands on my back, a fog lifts  
over cliffs, while Paula has long disappeared.

Watching ship going downriver &amp;<br> 
out to sea signaling a dispersal  
your letters, Paula, land in my hands.
