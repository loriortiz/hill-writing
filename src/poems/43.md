I am in Boulder, I am in Vienna,---  
I am in New York, I am in Norwich,   
I am in Constanta, I am in Istanbul,   
I am in Minsk, in Prague, in Bratislava,   
I am in Philadelphia,   
I am in Paris, I’m in Albany,  
I’m in Spotsylvania County,   
Herkimer County, St. Lawrence County,   
Montgomery County, Tuscony, Burgundy,   
Bucks County, Sullivan County, Pike   
County, Bezirk Zwettl,   
Ich bin in Wien, in Wien, in Wien.

I am in a coffee house, I sit in a park,   
I lie on Freud’s couch, with my leg’s propped  
up on a chair, my knees are bent, I sway  
my hips, do an ocho, a plié, I pray. 

I think of you, I don’t think, I  
have sorrow, I am free, I notice  
things, I stop. 

I noticed you, I didn’t love you,   
I loved you a bit, I loved you  
a lot. For a minute. Not a minute,   
it was a series of moments, it was  
an entire year. 

You are an immigrant, from New   
York, where I am not from, I was born  
in New York. You led me to a door, to  
a stairwell, there was no door, it was the   
N train, it was a street. 

We stood at a bar, didn’t stand, just  
hopped there, drinking smoothly,   
you spilled your beer as we sat,   
you stood up, undecided. 

We are both interested in   
Modernism at night, we   
have nothing in common at night.   
You speak of the golden ratio,   
You are not mathematic. You are   
a mathematic constant. 

I study a map of Constanta, studying  
a map of Constantinople, I   
translate. You are in Queens, you   
are in Pennsylvania, at the Black   
Sea. You sit in my bath tub, you   
stand there. I glance at you, I turn  
away, you are so much older, you’re much   
much younger, you are not much, you   
are just my age. Your friends,   
you don’t have any. 

You are impossible, possible,   
It is possible because we have   
the exact same birthday, the   
constant, I am so rational. 

You say I like this, I don’t  
like that, you hate my apartment,   
I hate your apartment,  
you like my chair, my towel,   
my sheets, you say they should   
have chopped off all those heads,   
you don’t like to be rushed, you  
are always rushing, you are  
gentle, subtle. 

You are an abstract concept, I   
like it, no I don’t. You are so   
grounded, I am the native   
here, you!

You are traumatized by   
Communism, I am traumatized  
by Capitalism, we have   
everything, nothing   
in common. 

I am sad, it dawned on   
me quickly, I am happy.
