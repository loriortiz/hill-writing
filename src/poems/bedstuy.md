“…to be free in every aspect.”  Mighty Beardo---

a stroller, a flaneur, the quiet      
of, there is snow, a snowy     
smile in perfect freedom,     
every aspect, this day     
brings, spectacle of, in the      
middle of the lane, its center—      
you are the center, I want  
to be a perception, captured,   
freedom captured, a split second  
of 50 million downy crystals, they  
fall in torrents, in waves sent   
from sky, from every angle a   
free light falls to ground, you   
say, "my interest is my heart"—  
this is what I hear—every aspect  
of supreme energy is the miracle  
of infinite crystals, the path, its  
schooling, its care, the reflection  
and time this takes.  
Lane lined with cars   
parked in snow as sky teaches  
the interest of the heart as  
you speak it, "my interest  
is my heart" and its reflection,   
schooling of snowy split  
seconds and dance of   
afternoon blizzard, success  
of snow-filled lane connecting  
via snowy beard and camera  
eye—your instrument for   
speaking to Europe, Africa,   
this Brooklyn street lined   
in heaping snow banks, tree  
branches weighing.  
The stroller, a bag of books, a  
scarf where a child sits   
develops a moment of liberating  
perspective and laid-back  
seeds of friendliness like   
seeds of light melt   
on lashes—being a parent  
means to fail.   
This is not an image of me, but  
of you and your heart in every  
aspect, in eternal freedom.
